# ATTENDANCE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM

This project aims to manage attendance at the workplace, college or schools via RFID card/tag with realtime SMS facility.

Function: When the RFID card/tag is placed on the RFID reader, it scans the card and checks the card UID stored on the microcontroller. Then it sends the SMS to the predefined mobile number with the help of the GSM Module when a valid card UID is found.
